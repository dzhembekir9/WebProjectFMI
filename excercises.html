            <h1 id="sec1">Barbell Bench Press</h1>

            <div>


                <p>The bench press is an upper-body weight training exercise in which the trainee presses a weight
                    upwards while lying on a weight training bench. The exercise uses the pectoralis major, the anterior
                    deltoids, and the triceps, among other stabilizing muscles. A barbell is generally used to hold the
                    weight, but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.

                    The barbell bench press is one of three lifts in the sport of powerlifting alongside the deadlift
                    and squat, and is the only lift in the sport of Paralympic powerlifting. It is also used extensively
                    in weight training, bodybuilding, and other types of training to develop the chest muscles.

            <h1 id="sec2">Squat</h1>

            <div>

                <p>A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and
                    then stands back up. During the descent of a squat, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle
                    joint dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when
                    standing up.

                    Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower body
                    muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary agonist muscles used during the squat are
                    the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus. The squat also
                    isometrically uses the erector spinae and the abdominal muscles, among others.

                    The squat is one of the three lifts in the strength sport of powerlifting, together with the
                    deadlift and the bench press. It is also considered a staple exercise in many popular recreational
                    exercise programs.

            <h1 id="sec3">Biceps Curl</h1>

            <div>

                <p>Biceps curl is a general term for a series of strength exercises that involve brachioradialis, front
                    deltoid and the main target on biceps brachii. Includes variations using barbell, dumbbell and
                    resistance band, etc. The common point amongst them is the trainee lifting a certain amount of
                    weight to contracting the biceps brachii, and tuck in their arms to the torso during the concentric
                    phase. Once the biceps brachii is fully contracted, then return the weight to starting position
                    during the eccentric phase.

            <h1 id="sec4">Deadlift</h1>

            <div>

                <p>Deadlift refers to the lifting of dead weight (weight without momentum), such as weights lying on the
                    ground. It is one of the few standard weight training exercises in which all repetitions begin with
                    dead weight. In most other lifts there is an eccentric (lowering of the weight) phase followed by
                    the concentric (lifting of the weight) phase. During these exercises, a small amount of energy is
                    stored in the stretched muscles and tendons in the eccentric phase if the lifter is not flexible
                    beyond the range of motion.

                    There are several positions one can approach when performing the deadlift, which include the
                    conventional deadlift, squat, and sumo-deadlift.

                    Although this exercise uses the hips and legs as the primary movers, it can just as easily be
                    considered a back exercise.

            <h1 id="sec5">Dips</h1>

            <div>

                <p>A dip is an upper-body strength exercise. Narrow, shoulder-width dips primarily train the triceps,
                    with major synergists being the anterior deltoid, the pectoralis muscles (sternal, clavicular, and
                    minor), and the rhomboid muscles of the back (in that order). Wide arm training places additional
                    emphasis on the pectoral muscles, similar in respect to the way a wide grip bench press would focus
                    more on the pectorals and less on the triceps. To perform a dip, the exerciser supports
                    themselves on a dip bar or from a set of rings with their arms straight down and shoulders over
                    their hands, then lowers their body until their arms are bent to a 90 degree angle at the elbows,
                    and then lifts their body up, returning to the starting position.</p>
