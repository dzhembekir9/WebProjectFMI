                incredible amount of size compared to many during this era.

            <p>

                Fellow rival of Ronnie Coleman, Jay Cutler came under fire in 2001 when he was shown to have used a
                banned diuretic during the Olympia that year which was eventually overturned, and his second-place
                finish helped push him into the spotlight for his first overall win in 2006.
